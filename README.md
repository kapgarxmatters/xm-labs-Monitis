# Monitis
Monitor your web performance and reliability for websites, servers, networks & applications.  This version of the integration is one way and is used when an alert is created in Monitis.

# Pre-Requisites
* Monitis SaaS - If you don't have one, [get one](http://www.monitis.com)!
* xMatters account - If you don't have one, [get one](https://www.xmatters.com)!

# Files
* [ExampleCommPlan.zip](ExampleCommPlan.zip) - This is an example comm plan to help get started. (If it doesn't make sense to have a full communication plan, then you can just use a couple javascript files like the one below.)
* [EmailMessageTemplate.html](EmailMessageTemplate.html) - This is an example HTML template for emails and push messages. 
* [FileA.js](FileA.js) - An example javascript file to be pasted into a Shared Library in the Integration builder. Note the comments

# How it works
Add a Contact in Monitis using the webhook type.  Use the contact for any alert rules.  When an alert is created, Monitis will send the information to xMatters to notify the on-call resource.

# Installation
Details of the installation go here. 

## xMatters set up
1. Steps to create a new Shared Library or (in|out)bound integration or point them to the xMatters online help to cover specific steps; i.e., import a communication plan (link: http://help.xmatters.com/OnDemand/xmodwelcome/communicationplanbuilder/exportcommplan.htm)
2. Add this code to some place on what page:
   ```
   var items = [];
   items.push( { "stuff": "value"} );
   console.log( 'Do stuff' );
   ```


## Application ABC set up
1. In your Monitis account, create a Contact.  http://www.monitis.com/support/alerts/alerting-via-webhook-contact
2. When you add your contact to a rule, you will have to verify the contact.  xMatters won't do that, so you will need to copy and paste the following url into a browser.

# Testing
Be specific. What should happen to make sure this code works? What would a user expect to see? 

# Troubleshooting
Optional section for how to troubleshoot. Especially anything in the source application that an xMatters developer might not know about, or specific areas in xMatters to look for details - like the Activity Stream?
